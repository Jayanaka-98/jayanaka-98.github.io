# **Exploring Game Level Map Generation with ChatGPT**

This experiment is on an intriguing experimentâ€”utilizing conversational AI, specifically ChatGPT, to generate game level maps for a Python-based game developed using pygame. The objective was to assess whether an AI model could create simple yet playable game maps based on specific prompts.

## Understanding the Game Map

A python game made using pygame in git repo https://github.com/Jayanaka-98/py-game-RPG is being used. 

The game's map structure consists of a 20x20 grid with various elements:

        'B': Walls
        'E': Enemy Character
        'P': Player Character
        '.': Space

The four edges of the map must be made up of walls and wall barries may be placed inside the map. The mechanics involve players and enemies moving and attacking in four directions (left, right, up, down), resulting in a game over upon collision. Victory requires eliminating all enemies.

## Experiment Setup

- The experiment involved providing ChatGPT with prompts related to map generation and observing its responses.

- I first explained ChatGPT how the game map works.

## Methodology

The game map design and game mechanics are explained to the moedel.

### Prompt 1 : 
    "This is a map for a game"
```python
"tilemap = [
    
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B..E...............B',
    'B..................B',
    'B....BBBB......E...B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.........P........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B....E.............B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.......BBB........B',
    'B.........B........B',
    'B.........B....E...B',
    'B.........B........B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'

]"
```

    "B means Walls, P means player and E means the enemy. Generate a simmilar map with same size with walls an all sides"

#### ChatGPT: 
```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```

ChatGPT successfully crafted a map of the specified dimensions, enclosing the area with walls along the perimeter. However, it didn't populate the interior with any enemies, players, or additional walls as it was not specified in the prompt.

### Prompt 2 : 
    "Give me a different map"

#### ChatGPT: 

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B..........E.......B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.......BBBB.......B',
    'B......E...........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B...E..............B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..BBBBB...........B',
    'B.........E........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B............P.....B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.......E..........B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```

This time it managed to produce a playable map whithough it was quite simple. 

### Prompt 3 : 
    "Give me another one"

#### ChatGPT: 
```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B........E.........B',
    'B.................B',
    'B...E.............B',
    'B.........E.......B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..........E.......B',
    'B..................B',
    'B...E..............B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.........P........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```

This marked a pivotal moment in the experiment where an error in map generation surfaced. Notably, rows 3, 4, and 5 displayed only 19 tiles instead of the requisite 20. To confirm this anomaly, I requested another map generation without rectifying the initial problem.

#### Prompt 4 : 
- Another

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, here's another variation of the map layout:

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B...........E......B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..........E.......B',
    'B..................B',
    'B......E...........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B..................B',
    'B...E..............B',
    'B..................B',
    'B.......P..........B',
    'B..................B',
    'B........E.........B',
    'B..................B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```



- Surprisingly it did not reproduce the error. 
- However, as this map is quite simple I asked for a harder map.

#### Prompt 5 : 
- Give me a harder map

ChatGPT: 
- Creating a more challenging map involves adjusting the placement and density of walls, enemies, and the player. Here's a map with a more intricate layout:

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B........E.........B',
    'B..BBBB............B',
    'B..B...............B',
    'B..B........E......B',
    'B..B...............B',
    'B..B.....BBBB......B',
    'B..B..........E....B',
    'B..B...............B',
    'B..B...............B',
    'B..B........P.......B',
    'B..B................B',
    'B..BBBB............B',
    'B.....E............B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```



This map introduces a more intricate maze-like structure with walls ('B'), enemies ('E') in challenging spots, and the player ('P') placed in a relatively open area. Adjustments like dead ends, narrow paths, and more obstacles make it trickier for the player to navigate without encountering enemies.

- It is marvelous that this LLM was able to grasp the concept of hardness of a level and generate a more challenging map without explaining it what to do.
- With this revelation I ased for a much harder map.

#### Prompt 6: 
- give me a harder map

ChatGPT: 
- Absolutely, here's a challenging map with a more complex layout:

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B.......E..........B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.B..BB.BB.BB.B..BB',
    'B.............E....B',
    'B.B..BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B.....E...........PB',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B.............E....B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```
This map features a denser maze structure with more intricate paths, dead ends, and multiple enemies ('E') scattered throughout. The player ('P') is placed in a relatively enclosed area, making it challenging to navigate without encountering enemies or hitting dead ends.

- The map was indeed harder, but the issue with the game michanics was revealed as the player character needs at least a 2 tile gap to pass through easily. Otherwise the hitbox of the player must alling with the empty space, accurate to the a pixel.
- To avoid this issue, I asked ChatGPT to keep a 2 tile spacing for the player to move.
- Here the map size error was also present.

#### Prompt 7: 
- There can only be 20 rows and 20 columns and there should be atleast two empty spaces for the player to move

ChatGPT: 
- Understood! Here's a challenging map within the constraints of 20 rows and 20 columns that ensures at least two empty spaces for the player to move:

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B.....E...........PB',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```

- Here the map did not change and the error was not corrected.
- To ensure the gap, I asked the model to maintain 2 tile gap.


#### Prompt 8 : 
- spaces should be in both columns and rows as consecutive pairs.

ChatGPT: 
- Understood! Here's a revised map with at least two empty spaces arranged in consecutive pairs in both columns and rows:

```python
tilemap = [
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B.....E...........PB',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..B............B..B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'B.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB.BB',
    'B..................B',
    'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB'
]
```



This map layout maintains the maze structure with walls ('B'), enemies ('E'), and the player ('P'), ensuring that there are at least two consecutive empty spaces in both rows and columns for the player to navigate within the constraints of the grid size.

- Here also the same result was presented.
- From here onwards the propmts did not change the map significantly or correct the mapsize error.

### Conclusion

As observed through this experiment, LLMs are definitely capable for generating unique game level maps. Howevere, the model needs to be fine tuned for the task to reliably generate maps which are harder than the previous level but playable.
